												How should the family members face with problem / pathological gambler?</h4>
											<p>
												When we are sick, we need to consult doctors. By following their advice, we can recover from the illness. Appling the same rule to the problem / pathological gamblers, they are also suffering from the “illness” of uncontrollable gambling. After they have received professional counseling to abstain from gambling and advised to repay the debt, their “illness” can be recovered. As their family members we need to seek help immediately. Only helping them to repay the debt is not a correct approach for their recovery.</p>
											<h4>
												How to manage problem / pathological gambler's finance?</h4>
											<p>
												If possible, all gamblers’ finance are handled by their family members. This temporary method is to let them have no money to gamble. If gamblers have made improvement after counselling, they can re-handle their finance.</p>
											
											<h4>
												How to live with gamblers?</h4>
											<p>
												To live with gamblers require your assertiveness in finance control, your patience to endure their unreasonable accusations, your courage to express your feelings towards their gambling behavior and your eagerness to bring them for counselling.</p>
